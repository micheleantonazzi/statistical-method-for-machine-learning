\title{Classify Images Using Deep Learning}
\author{Michele Antonazzi}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work, we perform a multi-classification task over images using deep learning models. The aim is to evaluate the neural networks' performances in relation with their type, architecture and hyper-parameters. The models tested are FFNN (feed-forward neural network) and CNN (convolutional neural network).
